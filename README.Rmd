## ANALYSIS PIPELINE

Analysis are carried out in the following order:


1. QC_and_mapping.Rmd
    + adapter and quality trimming of raw reads
    + mapping using STAR aligner
    + obtain stats from the above steps.

2. GenomicA_masking.Rmd
    + Criteria for genomic masking
    + create a bed annotation file for genomic A masking
    + remove genmic A-mask positions from data.

3. Sp_normalization.Rmd
    + count S.pombe reads
    + derive scaling factors using DESeq2
    + apply to scaling of S. cerevisiae tracks

4. BGSub.Rmd
    + Subtract background from 2' 4tU IPs using negative (mock) IP data.
    + sanity checks

5. pAminus.Rmd
    + Subtract [pA+] from [pA+ + pA-] data.
    + sanity checks  

6. body_end_counting.Rmd
    + gene body and end annotations
    + counting from various sample types
    + sanity checks
    + barplots, signal per type
    + piecharts, signal distribution
